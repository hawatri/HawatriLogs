  <p>Welcome to Hawatri<br />Welcome, traveler.</p>
   <hr />
  <p class="mt-5">
    You've stumbled upon Hawatri—a quiet corner of the internet where
    thoughts take shape, stories breathe, and ideas find a home.<br />
    This is not a blog in the noisy, click-chasing sense. It is a digital
    diary of sorts, grounded in simplicity, soaked in curiosity, and built
    with care.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-5">
    Here, I share more than vlogs.<br />
    I share projects that scratch an itch, solutions that solve problems,
    and experiments born from long hours and quiet determination.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-5">
    <strong>Who am I?</strong><br />
    I'm a programmer by trade, but more than that—a thinker, a builder, and
    a listener.<br />
    I was raised with a respect for tradition, and I carry that into my
    work: clean code, simple design, and functional ideas.<br />
    This site is a mirror of that philosophy.
  </p>

    <strong>What you'll find here</strong><br />
    Projects — From terminal tools to full-stack experiments, you'll see my
    builds evolve.<br />
    Solutions — Practical answers to real-world problems, many of them
    inspired by my own needs.<br />
    Vlogs — Not the flashy, fast-cut kind. Just slow, honest glimpses into
    the journey—tech and otherwise.<br />
    Thoughts — Reflections on code, life, process, and growth.<br />
    Whether you're here to learn, to explore, or just to wander through
    someone else's mental workshop—you're welcome.
  </p>
  <p class="mt-5">This is Hawatri. Let's build something meaningful.</p>
